                 Royal Challengers Bengaluru, also known as RCB, is the Bengaluru-based cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The team is owned by United Spirits Limited, a Diageo Group company.
                 RCB rose from a bottom-two finish in 2008 to end as runners-up in 2009 and semi-finalists in 2010. The team had 3 good seasons back-to-back when they made it to the final in 2011. Led by Virat Kohli, Royal Challengers Bengaluru yet again finished 2nd in 2016.
                 RCB has adopted the philosophy #PlayBold which resonates both on and off the field - Defeats donâ€™t defeat us, the Challenger Spirit keeps us alive'.
